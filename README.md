# ExAlgebra

This library collects a host of common functions that can be used in linear algebraic computations.

##### Vector
Functions that perform computations on vectors.

##### Vector3
Functions that perform computations on 3-vectors.

##### Matrix
Functions that perform computations on matrices.

## Installation

The package is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/exalgebra), and it can be installed as:

  1. Add exalgebra to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:exalgebra, "~> 0.0.4"}]
        end

  2. Ensure exalgebra is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:exalgebra]]
        end
